        description: 'A comprehensive advertising campaign for NOICE, focusing on brand strategy and high-impact visuals.',
        fullDescription: 'I worked on this NOICE ad campaign to solve a very specific modern branding problem: how do you make an impulse-led snack brand memorable in a category that\'s cluttered, fast-scrolling, and largely forgettable? Instead of competing on taste claims or health cues, I built the campaign around cultural recall positioning NOICE as the snack you end up with in unplanned social moments, not the one you plan for. Grounded in quick-commerce behavior and Gen Z insights, the strategy leans into music, humor, and influencer-native storytelling to bypass rational decision-making and trigger instant memory. From influencer collaborations and OOH to platform-first visuals and snackable copy, every touchpoint amplifies NOICE\'s existing chaotic, youth-first tone while making it feel emotionally sticky in seconds. This project showcases my ability to think in systems connecting consumer behavior, platform dynamics, and culture to build a campaign that\'s designed not just to be seen, but remembered.',

The narrative moves from instant attention ("Deadline at 2 AM?") to desire by highlighting low-sugar, barista-crafted cold brew, and converts seamlessly with Blinkit\'s express delivery and time-bound offers. Executed across short-form video ads, static posts, campus touchpoints, and Blinkit listings, the campaign blends insight-led strategy with platform-native storytelling to make Sleepy Owl feel like an essential midnight ritual rather than just another coffee brand .',

Starting with secondary research, data analysis, and real user interviews, I explored how factors like choice overload, social-media-driven expectations, outdated UX patterns, and lack of transparency contribute to anxiety, mistrust, and decision fatigue among users aged 20–35 in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. \nThrough persona building, empathy mapping, and competitor analysis, I translated these insights into a clear problem definition: users want fewer, more authentic matches and platforms that respect emotional complexity rather than treating marriage as a transaction.
